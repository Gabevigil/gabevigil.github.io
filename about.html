				<p>Hi, I’m Gabe </p>
					<p>I’m a Senior year student at New York University, majoring in Film and Television and minoring in Web Programming and Applications. </p>
					<p>I’m a creative with an immense passion for mixed media art, surrealism, funk and modern psychedelic music, special effects, and storytelling. I strive to prove myself as a creative director with a unique blend of these inspirations crafted into novel and outstanding projects. I have a strong interest in post-production processes I’ve been working with After Effects since I was 12 and have been recently enjoying compositing on student films.</p>
					<p>In addition to my artistic work, I am also interested in web development and helping traditional businesses adapt to modern internet and technology-based business models.</p>
					<p>Feel free to reach out to me on the socials page!</p>
